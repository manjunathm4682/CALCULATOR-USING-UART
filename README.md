**UART-Based Calculator**
This project demonstrates a basic calculator that uses UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) for communication, developed and tested using Keil uVision Version 5.

**Purpose**: 
Implement a simple calculator that processes arithmetic commands received via UART and displays results in the Keil uVision debug window.
Operations Supported: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Example Commands **:
Command: 5 + 3
Expected Output: 8 (displayed in the debug window)
